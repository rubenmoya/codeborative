Hi! I'm [@rubenmoya](http://twitter.com/@rubenmoya_) and this is my project at [Ironhack](http://ironhack.com).

## What is Codeborative?

Do you have a personal project and want to share your knowledge? Are you learning a new technology and looking for mentorship? Codeborative is your place!

In Codeborative you can search for a mentor based on the technology you want to learn in exchange of helping him with his project, both of you win!

And in the other hand, if you want some help with your project and you're willing to teach your helper, this is your web!


## Technologies used

The project is built with Ruby on Rails and a bunch of gems!
