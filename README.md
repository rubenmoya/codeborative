Hi! I'm [@rubenmoya](http://twitter.com/@rubenmoya_) and this is my project at [Ironhack](http://ironhack.com).

## What is Codeborative?

Do you have a personal project and want to share your knowledge? Are you learning a new technology and looking for mentorship? **Codeborative** is your place!

In **Codeborative** you can **search for a mentor** based on the technology you want to learn. In exchange, youâ€™ll **help him with his project**, both of you win!

## Technologies used

The project is built with Ruby on Rails, using Haml and SCSS. For real-time notifications and message system I'm using Pusher. And WebRTC for video/audio calls. The authentication system is built with Devise and Omniauth.

## How to use

- Clone the repository
- `bundle install`
- `rails s`.
